## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Senior Solidity Developer with deep expertise in designing and building secure, scalable, and gas-efficient smart contracts for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). My experience spans the entire Web3 stack - from protocol-layer development to dApp integration and developer tooling. I focus on writing production-ready, thoroughly tested contracts that are audit-friendly and optimized for real-world usage.

## ⚒️ Smart Contract Expertise

- **Languages & Standards**: 
  - Solidity (0.6–0.8+), Vyper (basic), Yul (intermediate)
  - Familiar with EVM opcodes, gas mechanics, and memory/storage layout
  - Token Standards: `ERC-20`, `ERC-721`, `ERC-1155`, `ERC-4626`, `ERC-2771`, custom interfaces

- **Security & Testing**:  
  - Reentrancy protection, access control, overflow/underflow (pre-Solidity 0.8.x), frontrunning, sandwiching, flash loan exploits
  - Testing Frameworks: `Foundry (Forge)`, `Hardhat`, `Truffle`
  - Static & dynamic analysis: `Slither`, `MythX`, `Echidna`, `Certora`, `Manticore`
  - Full test coverage, fuzzing, invariant testing, gas reporting, and code coverage tracking

- **Design Patterns**:  
  - Upgradeable Contracts: `UUPS`, `Transparent`, and `Beacon` proxies via `OpenZeppelin`
  - Role-based access control, pull/push payment patterns, time locks, pausable modules
  - Off-chain/on-chain interaction patterns using Chainlink, The Graph, Oracles, and Keepers

## 🌐 Web3 Development

- **Frontend Integration**:
  - Libraries: `Ethers.js`, `Web3.js`, `viem`
  - Frameworks: `Next.js`, `React`, `RainbowKit`, `wagmi`, `Web3Modal`
  - Wallets: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Safe

- **Subgraphs & Indexing**:
  - Created performant subgraphs with `The Graph` for real-time contract state queries
  - Defined efficient GraphQL schemas with dynamically updated mappings

- **On-Chain Data Management**:
  - Merkle tree commitments, off-chain data proofs
  - IPFS for decentralized metadata storage
  - Chainlink VRF and price feeds

## 🤝 Let's Build the Future of Finance

I'm always open to connecting with builders, researchers, and auditors working in the Ethereum and broader blockchain space. Whether you're working on DeFi protocols, DAO infrastructure, NFT tooling, or decentralized middleware, I'm excited to collaborate on secure, efficient, and impactful smart contracts.
